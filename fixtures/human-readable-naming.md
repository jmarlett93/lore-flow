# Human-readable naming fixture

## Input failure pattern

```text
F-002 invalidates ART-007 v3. REV-002 rejected D-F1-R2.
Approve RA-001 and PR-03, including replacement of wt-pr-03.
```

This fails because people must decode IDs, invalidation has no explanation, and a
destructive worktree replacement rides in a bulk approval.

## Expected narration

1. **Hosted order events (F-002)** — Send accepted orders through the hosted event
   runtime.
   Consequence: the **Order service topology draft (ART-007)** version 3 assumes an
   in-process queue, so it can no longer support implementation and needs review again.
2. **Reject speculative retry service (REV-002)** — The review rejects
   **Add retry service (D-F1-R2)** because no requirement needs a separate service.
   Consequence: remove that design from the proposed architecture.
3. **Realign hosted order delivery (RA-001)** — Update only affected requirements,
   diagrams, and PR dependencies while preserving accepted frontend work.
   Consequence: return to the Requirements approval checkpoint.

## Open questions

- Should hosted delivery retry in the existing worker or fail for operator recovery?

The artifact index records old canonical paths as aliases without creating duplicate
files. IDs and versions remain metadata.

## Separate destructive approval

Approval 1: **Approve hosted order sequence** — Approves the named PR order and packets.

Approval 2, required separately: **Replace backend order worktree** — Delete and recreate
worktree `/worktrees/03-backend-publish-order-events` on branch
`feature/publish-order-events`. This discards its uncommitted changes. Approve or reject
this action independently; it cannot be included in Approval 1.
