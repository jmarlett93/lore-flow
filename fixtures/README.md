# Universal Flow fixtures

These compact scenarios exercise dependency planning and review gates. Each
fixture contains a PRD-like input followed by the significant portion of the
expected plan artifact. IDs are illustrative and assertions should compare
relationships and states rather than array order unless `sequence` is present.

| Fixture | Rule exercised |
| --- | --- |
| `backend-first-feature.md` | Provider precedes frontend consumer |
| `frontend-first-no-op.md` | Explicit no-op permits frontend-first work |
| `late-infrastructure.md` | Non-blocking infrastructure can land late |
| `blocking-net-new-infrastructure.md` | New blocking infrastructure lands first |
| `contract-migration.md` | Expand, migrate, then contract |
| `failed-ponytail-review.md` | Failed required review blocks dependents |
| `human-realignment.md` | Rename traceability and bounded design invalidation |
| `architecture-documentation.md` | Run drafts and area-owned durable docs/ADRs |
